We’re a small business open for <span style="color: #9a322d; font-weight: 600;">over 10 years</span> so you’ll always be familiar with our faces.

We’re in <span style="color: #9a322d; font-weight: 600;">Tori Pines Plaza</span> among with other small businesses like <span style="color: #9a322d; font-weight: 600;">Las Fuentes Mexican Restaurant, Bottle Cellars, and Rich's Custard.</span>

<span style="color: #9a322d; font-weight: 600;">We’re normally a dine-in and takeout resturant, but due to current situations we are only doing takeout orders.</span>

Our hours, address, and phone are above. Or maybe you need some time to check out [**our menu here**](/menu). When you’re done, please call your order in. We look forward to serving you!
